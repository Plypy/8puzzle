# 8puzzle
It's a simple fork of 2048(https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

The master branch is used for my hexo based github page, and served
[here](http://pages.plypy.com/8puzzle). And the other branch node-server
inludes a simple server that plays role of a middle man of the backend AI
program and the frontend. The AI program, whose source is astar.cpp, which have
implemented the A* Algorithm, and used the cantor expansion as the hash function.
